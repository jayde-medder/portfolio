          In 2023, Re:Gear began with a small group of friends fixing up
          hardware junk at a community space in North East Valley. News caught
          on, and the e-waste started to pile up. We needed a way to keep track
          of everything we acquired, what state of repair it was in, and get it
          back out into the community.

              While researching inventory solutions, I realised we had the
              opportunity to build something unique to meet our needs.
              Initially, I was the sole developer on the team, but I soon sought
              the help of collaborators interested in honing similar skills.
              Although one collaborator joined for a while before moving away
              for work, I have continued to develop the app largely on my own.

              I'm actively looking for full-stack developers who are keen to
              donate their time to an important and fun local initiative while
              also building their skills. Please get in touch if you're
              interested developing or consulting.
